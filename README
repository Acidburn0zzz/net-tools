The comments and instructions below are for the new IP stack in Zephyr.
For Contiki based uIP stack, see instructions in README.legacy file.

Here are instructions how to communicate between Zephyr that is running
inside Qemu, and host device that is running Linux.

You need to run socat and tunslip to create a minimally working
network setup.

There are convenience scripts (loop-socat.sh and loop-slip-tap.sh) for
running socat and tunslip6 processes. For running these, you need two
terminals.

Terminal 1:
$ ./loop-socat.sh

Terminal 2:
$ sudo ./loop-slip-tap.sh

After running these scripts you do not need to manually restart
them when qemu process stops.

In the Qemu side, you need to compile the kernel with proper config.
Minimally you need these settings active in your project config file.

CONFIG_NETWORKING=y
CONFIG_NET_IPV6=y
CONFIG_NET_IPV4=y
CONFIG_NET_YAIP=y
CONFIG_NET_UDP=y
CONFIG_NET_LOG=y
CONFIG_NET_SLIP=y
CONFIG_SLIP_TAP=y
CONFIG_SYS_LOG=y
CONFIG_SYS_LOG_SHOW_COLOR=y
CONFIG_NANO_TIMEOUTS=y
CONFIG_TEST_RANDOM_GENERATOR=y

After you have the loop scripts and Qemu running running you can communicate
with the Zephyr.

If your have echo-server running in the Qemu, then you can use the echo-client
tool in net-tools directory to communicate with it.

# ./echo-client -i tap0 2001:db8::1

The IP stack responds to ping requests if properly configured.

$ ping6 -I tap0 -c 1 2001:db8::1

You can attach wireshark to tap0 interface to see what data is being
transferred.

If building with CONFIG_NET_TCP=y in your project config file, it's possible
to run the echo-server sample in Zephyr, and then test the TCP stack using
the supplied tcptest.py script:

$ ./tcptest.py tap0 2001:db8::1

This script will send numbers to the echo-server program, read them back,
and compare if it got the exact bytes back.  Transmission errors, timeouts,
and time to get the response are all recorded and printed to the standard
output.

Be sure to use Python 3, as it requires a function from the socket module
that's only available in this version (wrapper around if_nametoindex(3)).
